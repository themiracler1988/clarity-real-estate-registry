# Clarity Real Estate Registry Blockchain System

Welcome to the **Clarity Real Estate Registry**. This decentralized platform is built on the Stacks blockchain to provide secure and transparent property document management. The system allows property owners, administrators, and authorized users to register, update, transfer, and delete property records, ensuring that real estate transactions are immutable and verifiable on the blockchain.

## Features:
- **Property Registration**: Users can register property titles, upload documents, and assign descriptive metadata, making properties verifiable and traceable.
- **Property Updates**: Property owners can update property information such as title, document size, description, and tags.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Securely transfer ownership of properties between principals.
- **Property Deletion**: Remove outdated or erroneous property records from the registry.
- **Document Access Permissions**: Fine-grained control over who can view property documents and other sensitive data.
- **Tag Validation**: Ensures that property tags are in the correct format and meet the required standards.

## Core Components:
1. **Registry Storage**:
   - **Estate Registry**: Stores property documents and related metadata such as title, owner, and tags.
   - **Viewing Permissions**: Manages access control for property records, specifying who can view a given document.
2. **Governance & Permissions**:
   - **Admin Control**: Admins can perform special functions, including ensuring only the rightful owners can modify or delete property records.

## How It Works:
- **Registering Property**: A property owner can register a property by submitting a title, document size, description, and tags. The system validates the input and stores the property data on the blockchain.
- **Updating Property**: Property owners can update property information at any time by submitting new details. Only the current owner can modify a property’s record.
- **Transferring Ownership**: A property can be transferred to a new owner, ensuring ownership changes are fully transparent and immutable.
- **Deleting Property**: Property owners can delete records they own, with proper checks to ensure only the rightful owner can delete records.

## Smart Contract Functions:
- **register-property**: Registers a new property with metadata and tags.
- **update-property**: Updates details of an existing property, verifying ownership.
- **transfer-property**: Transfers ownership of a property to another principal.
- **delete-property**: Deletes a property from the registry, ensuring ownership validation.

## Security & Validations:
- **Tag Validation**: Ensures that property tags meet the required format and length.
- **Ownership Verification**: Functions like `update-property` and `delete-property` ensure that only the property owner can modify or remove records.
- **Access Control**: Viewing permissions are granted for property records based on user roles and access rights.

## Getting Started:
To interact with the real estate registry, you’ll need:
1. **Stacks Wallet**: Set up a wallet compatible with the Stacks blockchain.
2. **Stacks Node**: Connect to the Stacks blockchain node for deploying and interacting with the smart contract.

Once set up, you can interact with the contract using Clarity, the smart contract language for Stacks.

### Requirements:
- **Stacks Network**: Must use the Stacks blockchain for smart contract deployment and interaction.
- **Clarity**: Written in the Clarity smart contract language, which provides predictable and transparent execution.

## Installation and Usage:

To deploy and use the Clarity Real Estate Registry, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/clarity-real-estate-registry.git
   cd clarity-real-estate-registry
   ```

2. Deploy the smart contract to the Stacks blockchain using your Stacks wallet and node.

3. Use the appropriate Stacks tools (e.g., `clarity-cli`) or a custom front-end application to interact with the contract.
